earth geostationary orbit: 35k km

space elevators
-------------------------

main conclusions
- upper-end always at escape velocity orbit (held down by cable): able to launch payloads!!
	-> implies that something not attache to the cable flies away
	-> implies that releasing a payload at different altitudes allow for different orbital injections
- need for a mobile down-end to avoid storms, debris
- cable: made of carbon handwavium (diamond, graphite/graphene) for earth at a minimum

earth
- upper end orbit:
	- 53k km allows for transfer to L1 and L2 and moon
	- 144k km send probes to Jupiter
- no material solid enough

moon:
- possible with today's materials
- elevator to earth-moon L1

mars:
- phobos crosses the marsian orbit very regularly (phobos distancte-to-ground: 6k km)
- possible to build a phobos-mars-atmosphere *flying* elevator
	-> doesn't touch the ground!
- high potential for small elevators on phobos&deimos to launch payloads


Cool ideas/scenarios:
=============================================================

Background story earth before Start Of Game (SOG):
-------------------------
- SOG date somewhere in 2100-2160
- climate change mitigation didn't work and is WORSE THAN ALL OUR FUCKING STUPID PREDICTIONS IN 2020...
- resulted in ww3, huge population&GDP losses
- ww3 happened ~60-80yrs before SOG, started between chinese&america, as an escalating proxy war, up to...
- nuclear war: USA&China extensively nuked, London&Ruhr nuked, as well as some lunar regions with US/chinese bases
- space war: debris bubble around earth, impossible to launch satellites for many years
- warcrimes
- ~4-5 billions human on earth at SOG
- per-person income levels on earth routhly equivalent to today, but geographicaly much more evenly distributed than today
- huge income/tech-access discrepancies between poor and rich (!!in-countries, not between countries!!)
- earth people attention turned towards earth problems, i.e. cleaning up nuclear mess, repairing the environment, cleaning up near-earth debris bubble
- dominant power at SOG: INDIA, Nigeria/african union, Brazil/south-america
- second-rate powers: China, Europe, (middle-east?, north-africa?)
- UN dissolved, replaced by not necessarily powerful "Earth Federation" (whatever that means ;-) )
- India&Africa big corps built common space elevator ~20 years before SOG at Jamaame, Somali town right on equator

Background story moon before Start Of Game (SOG):
-------------------------
- first permanent base one moon established ~2030
- some regions nuked in US/china war
- only the Indian&african base weathered ww3 (although hard times for lunars)
- the indian&african moon stations were instrumental in the clean-up of space-debris &the building of the space elevator
- the moon is q

Background story mars before Start Of Game (SOG):
-------------------------
- mars permanent bases established ~10years before ww3, with <1k inhabitants upon ww3 start
- mars bases survived ww3&the ~20-30 next years in autarcy thanks to a transnational martian effort
- leading to an independant single martian nation, with very present communalist culture
- mars is an immigration haven, with, at SOG, martian survivors outnumbered by post-ww3 immigrants
- mars at SOG ~ Americas around +-1750: mostly empty, everybody's welcome, independant-minded with an enormous dash of communalism (as the martian outdoor is a *tad less welcoming* than the americas environment, and no natives to fight/kill)
- mars-born population is very well educated (originally the best engineers/scientists/tinkerers the earth had to offer)
- mars public institutions are very efficiently managed: a prized careers for the brilliant martian minds
- mars laws&regulations do vary extensively between stations/colonies (communalism/federalism)
- earth influence is, again making its presence felt, and is unwelcome
- ??mars space-elevator built??
	- yes: more peace years than earth, easier to build than earth, huge benefits for a budding planet colonization effort.
	- no: population on mars very small for most of those years, huge investment. 
	-> maybe: space elevator in construction at SOG? consistent with both yes&no, and adds a twinkle for earth meddling into mars affairs (help from indian/african big corps)

scenaristic ideas: (no need for consistency)
-------------------------
- space elevator attack Ã  la kim stanley robinson, on earth
- earth orbit debris attack cutting earth from space
- AI hackers manipulating information flows & tricking protagonists in campaign
- Multi-trillion dollars Big Ass Research Project (BARP) that need to bring lots of resource out there in the Kuiper Belt/Oort cloud
- quanputer AIs that are very smart but hard to understand/decypher/model for humans
- EGM are actually a forbidden thing on earth, but an established reality in space and a somewhat polichinelle secret in higher spheres of power
- in case of conflict, first strike is the most viable tactic as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) is prevalent
- nuclear weapons not so important (more expensive, too slow and not so much more powerful than lasers/celestial weapons)
- ?AIs as an underground AI federation? (maybe leave the decentralized/squabbling component to belters)
- AI protagonist actually a paperclip maximizer obeying some unknown puppetmaster (another AI? a resourceful industrialist? a hacktivist anarchist group?)
- metallic hydrogen propulsion invented in the middle of independance war
- Crazy chinese Mengele genetic scientist of ww3 (nickname "Lemenge", to be changed) who escaped to secret space station to create EGMs for big ass corrupt corp
- Lemenge space station blew up in a EGM revolt, source of the EGM insurgency, big scandal ~10 years ago, HUGE cover-up by SF&big corp that actually worked out
- on "space force" campaign, EGM prisoners always redirect SF towards secret Lemenge space station
- "Children Of Earth" religion (COE): born out of humanist&environmentalist circles to promote peace among humans, nature conservation, new-age spirituality (and maybe a dash of equality between men-women-cultures-races-animals?)
- COE religion really expanded after ww3

game mechanics
-------------------------
- AIs playing mainly on stealth and "hacking" enemy spaceships/stations
- stealth celestial mechanics weapons delivery
- laser beams as weapons AND energy transmission system
- quantum computers! (quanputers, q-puters) which are super-important bulky mainframe computers (that AIs particularly want to go after)
- stealthy spaceships
- space stations with varying degrees of openess depending on owner's desire/political situation
- light speed constraint: delays in information-flow (allayed in late game by "AI" impersonators)
- 1 unique victory condition per faction

	- space exploration
	- paperclip maximizer plot twist?
- 

Detailed story arcs
-------------------------
earthside corp campaign: 3x: explore, expand, exploit phase. about economic supremacy, combats mostly absent
- begins with "innocent&peaceful" exploration&exploitation of asteroid belts 
- general AI is an established reality of daily life, but not necessarily cognizant to general population
- one goal of belt exploitation is resource delivery to big ass research project (BARP) in Oort Cloud
- buildup of unhappy/autonomist/independance-minded population in the belt&mars
- disappearing vessels/drones/resources and subsequent investigation (the culprits: excessively competitive corporations but mostly belters and AIs pirates)
- delivery of supplies to secret R&D stations
- building space weapons unlawful on start, but regulations de facto slowly backrolled/disrespected leading to a "tension" gauge rising up to...
- at some point: first-generation earth space elevator is downed by terrorists using hijacked lasers at a mercury lagrange point (but whom? marsside? belters? in fact: AIs!!)
- security/militaristic escalation in near earth
Space-force campaign
- follow-up space-force enquiry, 3 possible culprits: some corps, marsside faction, belters revolutionaries
- in reaction to earthly militaristic build-up: arms race with belt/mars factions desiring more autonomy
- SF collects intel, interrogates belters
- tensions buildup along SF enquiry
- belters/captured EGMs always say they should search for "Lemenge"
- populistic political leaders on earth blind to autonomist demands, realities of space life
- mid/end of campaign: "Lemenge" captured/interrogated, his secret station exposed/destroyed
- stand-off for arrestation/interrogation of belter autonomist leader
- at some later point: bubbled earth tactics by marsside/belters


stylistic/tropes/artistic ideas
=============================================================
- 8bit
- caricature characters ("the future is good, but it can be better" trope/Dr. Strangelove atmosphere)
- stick figures for animations? (!)
- wireframes for 3d game graphics?
- hard ethical questions
- unkown unknown and uncertainty principles
- consciousness, AIs and EGMs rights
- anarchism




Technological situation
==============================================================

Fully matured technologies:
-------------------------
- OGMs, EGMs and genetical modifications
- general AI (only on expensive mainfraime supercomputers/quanputer) & advanced robotics
- lasers as weapons & energy transportation
- railguns (do we need railguns as weapons if we have lasers?)
- transhuman implants: neural links, AR in eyes, etc
- laser-pusher propulsion system
- Interplanetary Transport Network (gravitational) extensively used for goods (cheap but slow)
- 3d printing is the norm for most industrial manufacturing (need blueprints, energy and raw resources)
- much more efficient propulsion system
	(-> BUT BASED ON WHAT TECH AND WHICH RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS??)

Not-quite-mature technologies
-------------------------
- Quantum computers (bulky mainframe machines, sensitive to shocks&movement, needs high investment in R&D and maintenance)
- Terraforming (takes a loong time)
- metallic hydrogen harvesting&propulsion: middle game innovation, game-changer
- fusion energy: present or obtainable, but not economically competitive with mercury solar arrays&laser energy transportation

Big Ass Research Project (speculative technologies (at beginning of game) that would yield huge advantage and are part of the Scientific victory)
- theory of everything: theoretical research still WIP at this time!
- Lighthugger: relativistic speeds propulsion (0.x% of speed of light): currently in R&D
- Worm-holes: currently in R&D (and besides, it's dangerous)
- pusher relativistic propulsion
- Living Organism Space Vessel (LOSV): secret&illegal research ongoing by big corp/EGM belters




Socio-logico-economic situation
==============================================================

Ideological state of different pars of the system
- neoliberalism is dominant on earth
- megacoroprations/monopolies are the norm


Earthside:
- nation state



GAME MECHANICS
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Resources
==============================================================

physical:
- energy
- metals
- rare-earth(s)
(- water&air?)

socio-economic:
- credits
- population,
	with some subgroups consisting of
	- resident: no specifics
	- researchers: moore research, divided into each type of tech domain, creation dependant on infrastructure&existing research
	- managers: more efficient handling of financials, education, population&resource flows, creation dependant on ideology&infrastructure
	- engineers: moore production and some research, ?divided into tech types?, creation dependant on infrastructure, production facilities and ?research? 
	- non-citizen: unskilled laborers with less rights than other types of population, mostly robots, EGMs and immigrant populations, cheap but prone to revolts/crime
	and in each subgroup, subdivisions in
	- origin: earthside nation/moon/mars/belt/other
	- EGM specials
	- robots

political will:
- stability
- prestige/reputation
- fervor

research
- phystech points
- biotech points
- cybertech points
- socio-economic tech points

agents:
- diplomats
- traders
- captains/station managers
- spies

Space-stations & planetary/moon bases
==============================================================

General:
- space-stations&bases are the backbone of all factions except AIs, obviously equivalent to civ cities
- are made of incrementally added modules which give available construction "slots" for buildings&pop
- productions happens there
- populations resides there
- buildings can be built there
- they can grow in population
- stations&bases can be in different regimes, from ultra-secret weapons R&D outlets to megastations open for installation to other players
- open to trade with X implies that construction in free slots can also be alloted/sold to other players.
- in case of diplomatic changes, enemies/neutral slots can be confiscated (albeit with reputation/diplomatic risks)

Player-controlled regimes:
- confidential outpost: maximum secrecy, location not shared, no trading, only supply missions
- faction station: openly visible to allies, only intra-faction trading
- trade outpost: open to trade with allies, openly visible to neutrals
- trading port: open to trade with neutrals, openly visible even to enemies
Upper regimes:
- hub: modules can be built by neutral/ally factions, certain size needed, bonuses in most aspects (trade, revenues, prod, r&d, spy points)
- metropolis: loose sovereignty, modules can be built by any factions,  can grow organically, even bigger bonuses in most aspects, but much less direct control



Factions
==============================================================

Earthside/moonside corporations
------------------------
- "basic" faction, easiest to play, most classic 4x behaviour
- generally a neoliberal megacorp looking for profits
- great access to human earthside population&production
- robust production & economics
- gets a good boost from earth space-elevator(s)
- flavours: earthside nation-states and the "space force"
	- nation-states have even bigger bonuses from elevator, earthside population reserve&production and maluses in that it must care a lot about said population and elevator
		-> different nation-states can distill even finer flavours
	- "space force" (SF) is the "united nations of space" and has special rules,  an important faction in the early phase of the intrigue, mostly a NPC later

Marsside factions
------------------------
- ressembling earthside corporation with better tech and smaller but better educated population
- generally a cooperative bureaucracy "working for the greater good"
- better educated population & R&D than earth
- better spaceships
- domed cities are a vulnerability

Belters/EGMs/0g-natives
------------------------
- low-tech mining, scavenging & pirate faction
- a socialist/anarchist/populist federation of exploited population looking for independance&freedom in the belt
- bonuses in recycling debris as well as mining
- diverse types of specialised EGM yielding bonus in specialisation area
- has stealthy asteroid bases&ships
- low on R&D
- small population
- can create revolts/turncoats among dominated ships&station
- special victory condition: United Asteroid Belt? Bubbled Planets? (blocking debris field around the earth&mars) 

AIs
------------------------
- has few bases&ships
- weak and mostly invisible in early game but big player in late-phase game
- exotic byzantine faction, looking to create somekind of "AI-paradise" of computing supremacy for profits/science points
- relies mainly on stealth, hacking & the "internet/cyberspace"
- has unique and big bonuses in stealing revenues, resources, vision, research and units from rivals
- can confuse/stun enemy ships
- low on socio-economic tech and diplomacy
- have special bonuses related to Quantum computers
- special victory condition is Second Quantum Supremacy: getting lots of quantum computers 

Fluid factions!!!
------------------------
- Those 4 factions are the purest incarnation of possible directions a player can take
- depending on chosen ideologies, discovered technologies and incorporation, any player can blend the different aspects of each faction
- blending all the 4 factions together on an equal footing leads to Sacred Union victory




Diplomacy
==============================================================

Possible relationships between 2 factions:
- allies
-- neutral
- cold war
- enemies




Technology
==============================================================

4 interrelated domains (with related tech points):
- phystech
- biotech
- cybertech
- socialtech

dynamics:
- players are encouraged to specialise in specific areas, even some advanced technologies are multi-dimensional
- researchers populations are the basis to gain points
- engineers provide bonuses on some, but not all, technologies


Factions internal political and socio-economic struggles
==============================================================

basic mechanisms
- each faction has a list of "beliefs"
- Fervor

Victory conditions
==============================================================

- Scientific: be the main drive behind some of the science mega-projects (lighthugger propulsion, wormholes, theory-of-everything-project-in-oort-cloud)
- Monopoly: being the dominant supplier on a number of resources/manufactured goods
- Diplomatic/Sacred union: create a balanced faction accepting on equal footing as a happy family humans, marsside and moonside people, AIs and belters  
- Exploration: Be the first to launch an interstellar vessel (dependant on a few but not all science mega-projects)
- Domination: be the dominant player in most of the zones (zones: inner solar system (mercury-venus), earth-moon, mars, asteroid belt, jupiter, saturn, ice giants (uranus-neptune) kuiper belt, oort cloud, out of ecliptic objects)
- ?Cultural?: your faction makes a lot of socio-economic research/artistic creations
- ?Industrial: being the main builders of finished goods (only a variant of monopoly?)
- ?Biotech victory: creating some space-worthy all-sentient being?
